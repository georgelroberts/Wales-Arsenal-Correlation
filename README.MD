Recently, I have started to believe there is some correlation (note, correlation not causation - I'm not crazy) between Wales and Arsenal results.
As a fan of both teams, it seems to me that whenever one team loses on a weekend, so will the other team; the same goes for wins. 

This python script aims to test the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between Wales and Arsenal results.
